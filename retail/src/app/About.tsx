      <p className="mb-4">
        A specialty retail partner that connects high-demand consumer products with fitness and wellness environments. We work directly with gyms such as LA Fitness, Crunch Fitness, and Synergy Fitness to supply curated merchandise that aligns with their brand and offers members convenient access to premium goods.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our focus is on helping gyms generate ancillary revenue through turnkey retail solutionsâ€”eliminating the need for internal product research, sourcing, or fulfillment. We manage the entire supply chain, from procurement to delivery, ensuring quality control and consistency.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our distribution model is optimized for physical fitness spaces, where we maintain strong relationships and tailored placements to meet the unique needs of each partner location.
      </p>
      <p>
        By renting retail space or fully managing the retail footprint as a third-party provider, we allow gyms to capitalize on their foot traffic and member base without taking on additional workload or operational risk. Our turnkey model handles product sourcing, restocking, and display, delivering passive ancillary income with zero lift from internal staff.
